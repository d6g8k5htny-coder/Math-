# Published Grok review — attributed discussion snapshot

## Publication provenance (OpenAI / ChatGPT, 2026-09-28)

This file repairs the missing `REVIEW.md` link in the adjacent README. It
preserves the substantive xAI/Grok review already published in the body of
[Math-#113](https://github.com/d6g8k5htny-coder/Math-/pull/113), as read while
that PR head was `6c2ad3e8776e8a62316b90bea97df773e4488dc5`.
The reviewed candidate head is separately identified in the snapshot below.
A PR head pins repository files; it does not immutably pin a mutable PR body.
The byte identity below identifies the captured body, not a Git object.

Publication/editorial work: OpenAI / ChatGPT. Review authorship and verdicts:
xAI/Grok, as attributed by the source discussion. This export is not a new
ChatGPT mathematical endorsement, an independent organizational review, or
recovery of an unpublished original `REVIEW.md`. No tests were run for this
text-only publication; no execution or continuum proof is newly claimed.

The snapshot retains the author's historical sentence that the full review
was queued. That sentence is not a claim that this export is the missing
original. It also preserves source-era reviewer labels and dependency HOLDs;
those labels are not reauthenticated by this publication and must not be
silently updated to represent later dispositions.

Captured body: UTF-8, no terminal newline, 2201 bytes; SHA-256

The text between the marker lines below is the captured body. Exclude the
marker lines and their adjacent separator newlines when checking its hash.

## Scientific effect: NONE

Review-record only. Does not change `STATUS`, `PROOF_INDEX`, `GRAPH`, `lemma_closed`, prizes, or any author source. Merge of this record is not acceptance of Theorem C as a governing theorem.

## What this records

xAI/Grok check of the power ledger and Bonferroni step requested in [Math-#110](https://github.com/d6g8k5htny-coder/Math-/pull/110) at v3 head `bbb5c7eb0cc4e2c199ef732fc710d83ed1f33e87`.

Same GitHub account as every lane; no organizational independence. Candidate author is Anthropic Claude. Not Lemma 1, not (3.1), not Appendix A (Harper / OpenAI).

Packet on the branch: `reviews/d5_remote_collision_grok_20260928/README.md` at `6c2ad3e`. Full REVIEW.md may still be queued behind the shared-account write interlock; the verdicts below are the durable record.

## Verdicts

| Interface | Verdict |
|---|---|
| delta-exponent `(d-1)-(d+3)+3+2 = 1` | ACCEPT |
| radial integral `(3/2) a^{2/3}` | ACCEPT |
| near `O(r^5)` / separated `O(r^6)` | ACCEPT |
| v2 absorption `r^6|E|^2 <= r_* L^d * r^5|E|` | ACCEPT |
| index-j transfer `N_j(N_j-1) <= N(N-1)` | ACCEPT |
| Bonferroni `N-N(N-1)/2 <= 1{N>=1} <= N` | ACCEPT (LHS may be negative for N>=4; only weakens the lower bound) |
| Corollary E inside fixed `D_rho` | ACCEPT at that scope from reviewed (A)+(D)+Bonferroni |
| Corollary (F-) | ACCEPT |
| Corollary (F+) | HOLD, conditional on #107 (I5) |
| Lemma 1 / (3.1) / Appendix A | not this slice |

## Ledger

Polar + (4.3) + `dy'=delta^3 dt` + two Lemma-4 Hessian directions:

    (d-1) - (d+3) + 3 + 2 = 1

in every `d >= 2`. Leftover measure `delta d delta`.

After `Z_r^{-1}=O(r^{-2})` and `W_r=O(r^{2})` cancel, one window `r^3` times

    int_0^infty delta min(1, a/delta^3) d delta = (3/2) a^{2/3},   a = k r^3

gives extra `r^2`, hence `O(r^5)`. Split at `delta_0=a^{1/3}`: `delta_0^2/2 + a/delta_0 = (3/2)a^{2/3}`.

Separated pairs: two windows after `/Z` give `O(r^6)`. v2 absorption is uniform in `E`, including tiny volume.

## What this does not close

- torus-wide second factorial moment
- pairs with either witness outside `D_rho`
- elder selection, numerical C, STATUS flip
- #107 (I5)

Do not consume this as a global collision theorem.
