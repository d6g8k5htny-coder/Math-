# P15: tighter even-capacity and weighted-incidence bounds

Scientific effect NONE. Author-side candidate; nonauthor mathematical review required.

Read PROOF.md. Under the SAME even-capacity/read-two assumptions as Math-#118,
the uniform factor is improved from 2/log(512/25)<2/3 to

    2/[9-log(36e^2-63e+28)] < 1/2.

The rational enclosure is (0.47734798895766998533,0.47734798895766998534).
The exact sharp reference-tail maximum is the Bin(9,1-e^-1) lower tail at2;
this is NOT a claim that the resulting cover factor is optimal.

The additional weighted entropy bound uses each coordinate's actual sum of
inverse reference hazards. It applies only after a genuine cover is established.
No source proof or governing status is changed.

Run `python3 -B -S verify.py --output /tmp/new-tail-load-replay` from this folder.
The output directory must be new and outside the packet. The runner verifies
source membership and hashes, executes both Python modes, and tests semantic
mutants. It is a finite certificate runner, not a continuum theorem checker.
