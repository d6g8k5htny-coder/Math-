# Theorem B of [LP] with explicit constants on the C8 band (`d = 2, 3`): the radial ledger to second order, two-sided lifetime densities, and the difference constant `C_{B,K}`

**Object:** `CL-C8-LIFETIME-DIFFERENCE-CONSTANT-20261001-v1`. **Author lane:** Anthropic / Claude.

**Kind.** An author-side theorem with explicit constants, certified by exact rational interval arithmetic (standard library
only). It uses Taylor models in the radius for the pin law, and the box-bound engines of Math-#206 and Math-#212 for the cap
route.

**Scientific effect:** NONE. Catalog entry C8 (`reviews/candidates_pending_20260928/CANDIDATES.md`) stays OPEN. No STATUS,
PROOF_INDEX, GRAPH or catalog edit. Same GitHub account as every lane; zero organizational-independence credit. The author will

## 0. Statement

**Setting** ([LP] sections 1, 10, 11 with `d in {2, 3}`, `m = d - 1`).
- The torus `X = (R / L Z)^d` with the periodized Gaussian kernel `K_L`, or the reference kernel `exp(-|z|^2/2)`.
- For an orthonormal frame `R` with axial vector `u`: the pins `M = -(r/2) u`, `S = (r/2) u`, `f(M) = b`, `f(S) = b - k r^3`,
  `grad f(M) = grad f(S) = 0`, the regression law `Q`, the typed weight `W_r`, and `Z_r = E_Q W_r`.
- [LP] (10.2) writes the candidate intensity per unit volume as `r A_r(b, k, u) dr db dk dsigma(u)` with

      A_r(b, k, u) = 12 pi_r(R; v_r) Z_r / r^2,

  where `pi_r(R; v_r)` is the density of the preconditioned pins (3.1) at their prescribed value (3.3).
- The band is `B = [0, 1]`, `K = [1/2, 2]`.
- The **reference contact integrand** is the closed form

      A_0^ref(b, k) = 432 (2 pi)^-(d+1) 12^(-1/2) k^2 exp(-12 k^2) exp(-3 b^2/4) m_d(b),

      m_2(b) = (b^2 + 2) Phi(b/sqrt2) + sqrt2 b phi(b/sqrt2),          m_3(b) = E[det(B)^2 1{B > 0}],  B = b I + GOE_2.

  This is the integrand of [LP] (11.3) for the reference kernel: `pi_0 = (2 pi)^-(d+1) 12^(-1/2) exp(-3b^2/4 - 12k^2)` and
  `z_0 = 36 k^2 m_d(b)`. `m_3` has the closed form of [E3] section 6.

**Theorem L (the radial ledger to second order).** For `d = 2, 3`, every torus side `L >= 10`, every frame, every `b in B`,
`k in K`, every `R` in the table and every `0 < r <= R`,

    -(a_dn(R) r^2 + eps_d)  <=  A_r(b, k, u) / A_0^ref(b, k) - 1  <=  a_up(R) r^2 + eps_d.

The same holds for the reference kernel. The constants are exact rationals (`RESULTS.json`), shown here rounded up:

| `R` | `a_up`, `d = 2` | `a_dn`, `d = 2` | `a_up`, `d = 3` | `a_dn`, `d = 3` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1/4096` | `13.822900` | `3.637234` | `25.666574` | `25.516405` |
| `1/2048` | `13.825546` | `3.643346` | `26.256537` | `26.108063` |
| `1/1024` | `13.830901` | `3.655573` | `27.446808` | `27.301701` |
| `1/512` | `13.841872` | `3.680046` | `29.869053` | `29.730582` |
| `1/256` | `13.864854` | `3.729062` | `34.883076` | `34.757367` |
| `1/128` | `13.915029` | `3.827402` | `45.611590` | `45.508415` |
| `1/64` | `14.032636` | `4.025510` | `70.060400` | `69.981330` |

with `eps_2 <= 3.96 x 10^-10` and `eps_3 <= 1.79 x 10^-8`. These collect the torus, truncation and rounding remainders and
do not depend on `r`.

What Theorem L gives, and what it does not:
- **It gives** the second-order coefficient of the deviation of the ledger from the reference contact integrand, `a(R)`,
  up to the radius-independent `eps_d`. [LP] proves the convergence ((10.3)) and states in section 11 that "Convergence of
  `A_r` to `A_0` was not assigned a numerical rate."
- **It does not give** a vanishing-remainder rate. `eps_d` does not tend to `0` with `r`. On the torus, Theorem L
  therefore does not prove `A_r = A_0 (1 + O(r^2))` for the torus limit `A_0`. With [LP] (10.3) it gives only
  `|A_0 / A_0^ref - 1| <= eps_d` for that limit. A vanishing-remainder rate would need the torus corrections tracked as
  functions of `r`, which the certificate does not do.

There is no first-order term:
- for the Gaussian kernel, the law of the transverse Hessian at `M` is the contact law at every `r` (Lemma 1);
- the first-order parts of `Z_r / r^2` cancel exactly (Lemma 3).

In the plane `a_up` is attained at `k = 2`, where the genuine coefficient is about `13.2`–`13.4` (Monte Carlo, section 9).

**Corollary L1 (lifetime densities to second order).** Let `nu_cand`, `nu_eld` be the compact-window densities of [LP]
Theorem B for pairs at distance at most `r_pop`, in the versions (11.2). For `0 < ell < min(r_pop, R)^3 / 2`:

    | ell^(1/3) nu_cand(ell) - c^ref_{B,K} |  <=  c'_up(R) ell^(2/3) + eps'_d,    (upper and lower sides with c'_up, c'_dn)
    ell^(1/3) nu_cand(ell) - C_{B,K}(R) ell  <=  ell^(1/3) nu_eld(ell)  <=  ell^(1/3) nu_cand(ell).

- `c^ref_{B,K} = |S^(d-1)| int_{B x K} A_0^ref / (3 k^(2/3))` is certified. Its enclosures contain the values of Math-#197 and
  Math-#205:
  - `d = 2`: `[0.002386938000079198, 0.002386938059531751]`;
  - `d = 3`: `[0.000974382342936858, 0.000974382390951253]`.
- `c'_up(R) = |S^(d-1)| sum_boxes a_up,box int_box A_0^ref / (3 k^(4/3))` is the weighted second-order constant, and `c'_dn`
  is the same with `a_dn`. As ratios to `c^ref`:

  | `R` | `c'_up/c`, `d = 2` | `c'_dn/c`, `d = 2` | `c'_up/c`, `d = 3` | `c'_dn/c`, `d = 3` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `1/4096` | `6.2826` | `4.4646` | `23.154` | `22.428` |
  | `1/512` | `6.3221` | `4.5056` | `27.378` | `26.662` |
  | `1/64` | `6.6431` | `4.8364` | `67.061` | `66.397` |

  (Rounded up. All seven `R` are in `RESULTS.json`.)
- `eps'_2 <= 1.2 x 10^-13` and `eps'_3 <= 2.5 x 10^-12`, absolute.

Hence, up to an additive `eps'_d ell^(-1/3)`, both compact-window densities are `c^ref_{B,K} ell^(-1/3) + O(ell^(1/3))`
with explicit constants. [LP] remarks that (1.2) "is an O(ell^(2/3)) difference, not a claim that either density separately
has a second-order expansion with that remainder".
- **What Corollary L1 is.** A two-sided expansion of each density about the reference constant.
- **What it is not.** Its remainder `eps'_d ell^(-1/3)` does not vanish as `ell -> 0`. For the torus constant `c_{B,K}`
  (any `L >= 10`) it gives `|c_{B,K} - c^ref_{B,K}| <= eps'_d`, not a second-order expansion about `c_{B,K}` with a
  vanishing remainder.

For example, in the plane, for `ell < 2^-19`:

    -4.84 ell^(2/3) - 10^-10  <=  ell^(1/3) nu_cand(ell) / c_{B,K} - 1  <=  6.65 ell^(2/3) + 10^-10,

which is a relative error below `1.1 x 10^-3`.

**Corollary L2 (explicit [LP] (1.2), (12.1), (12.3)).** For `0 < ell, t < min(r_pop, r_*)^3 / 2` and `q > -5/3`:

    0 <= nu_cand(ell) - nu_eld(ell) <= C_{B,K}(r_*) ell^(2/3),
    0 <= E[N_cand(0, t] - N_eld(0, t]] <= (3/5) C_{B,K}(r_*) t^(5/3),
    E sum_{candidate, not selected, ell <= t} ell^q <= C_{B,K}(r_*) t^(q + 5/3) / (q + 5/3),

and the selected count satisfies

    (3/2)(c^ref - eps') t^(2/3) - (3/4) c'_dn t^(4/3) - (3/5) C_{B,K} t^(5/3)  <=  E N_eld(0, t]  <=  (3/2)(c^ref + eps') t^(2/3) + (3/4) c'_up t^(4/3).

The certified difference constants (exact rationals in `RESULTS.json`, rounded up), with the relative size of the bound
at `ell = r_*^3/2`, `C_{B,K} ell / c^ref_{B,K}` (rounded up):

| `r_*` | `C_{B,K}`, `d = 2` | `(3/5) C_{B,K}` | `C ell/c` at `r_*^3/2` | `C_{B,K}`, `d = 3` | `(3/5) C_{B,K}` | `C ell/c` at `r_*^3/2` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1/4096` | `402.5297` | `241.5178` | `1.3e-06` | `1205.7089` | `723.4254` | `9.1e-06` |

[LP] section 11 gives (1.2) in the form `C ell^(2/3) integral A^*/(3 k^(5/3))` with no value for either factor, and its
section 16 lists "a numerical r_* or C on a prescribed band" among the items not supplied.

**What the refinement and the cap route contribute** (`r_* = 1/4096`):
- **Box resolution.** On their own boxes, the per-band bounds of [E] and [E3] give `2325.98` in the plane and `4999.57` in
  `d = 3`. The refined boxes improve these by factors `5.8` and `4.1`. [E] has `28` boxes, the coarsest `k`-box being
  `[1/2, 1]`; [E3] has `39`.
- **A single constant.** Using one sup constant `C(r_*)` of [E] or [E3] times the total weight gives `22467.8` and `38970.6`.
- **The reference-kernel cap-route benchmark.** `Gamma_{B,K} = |S^(d-1)| int A_0^ref c_G / (3 k^(5/3))` is built from
  the reference-kernel cap-failure coefficients `c_G` of [G] and [G3]. It is the reference-kernel asymptotic lower
  benchmark for any cap-route bound that is uniform over the present family. That family contains the reference
  kernel, so as `r_* -> 0` such a bound can give no less than `Gamma_{B,K}`. In floating point, `Gamma_2 = 307.5` and
  `Gamma_3 = 541` (section 9).
  - `C_{B,K}(1/4096)` is within a factor `1.31` of that benchmark in the plane and `2.23` in `d = 3`. These floating
    ratios compare our finite-radius bounds with the benchmark. They do not identify the exact cap-route limit of each
    finite torus, which would use the torus `A_0^L` and `c_G^(L,u)`; [G] says the torus deviation from `c_G^ref` is not
    enclosed.
  - The `d = 3` excess comes from the [E3] box bounds near `k = 1/2`, which are about `2.2 c_G^(3)` there.
- **The cap route itself is loose.** By [G], the cap criterion overstates the actual elder-pairing failure rate by
  `7.4 x 10^4` at `k = 1/2`. `C_{B,K}` bounds the [LP] quantity as [LP] defines it; it is not an estimate of the true
  difference.
- **Above `r_* = 1/512`** the certified per-band bounds of [E] and [E3] grow quickly; their own `C(r_*)` tables show the same
  jump. The useful range is `r_* <= 1/512`.

## 1. The radial ledger and what is consumed

[LP] sections 8–11 are consumed as statements:
- **Section 9.** The weighted Kac–Rice identity on the near-diagonal pair domain.
- **Section 10, the ledger (10.1)–(10.2).** The candidate intensity is `r A_r dr db dk dsigma(u)`. The selected intensity
  carries the extra factor `p_r`. `A_r` does not depend on the transverse frame.
- **Section 11, the pushforward (11.1)–(11.2).** For `ell < k_- r_pop^3`,

      nu_cand(ell) = ell^(-1/3) int_{B x K x S^(d-1)} A_{(ell/k)^(1/3)}(b, k, u) / (3 k^(2/3)) db dk dsigma(u),

  and `nu_eld` has the extra factor `p_r`.
- **Section 8.** `0 <= 1 - p_r <= Q^W(G_r^c)`.

Theorem L is a statement about `A_r` alone. The corollaries follow by integration.
- **Corollary L1.**
  - At fixed `ell < R^3/2`, every `k in K` has `r = (ell/k)^(1/3) <= (2 ell)^(1/3) < R`, and `r^2 = ell^(2/3) k^(-2/3)`.
  - Integrate Theorem L box by box against `A_0^ref / (3 k^(2/3))`. This gives `c^ref + ell^(2/3) c'_up + eps'` above and the
    mirror image below.
  - `A_0^ref` does not depend on `u`, so the sphere contributes `|S^(d-1)|`.
  - The integrals of `ell^(-1/3)`, `ell^(1/3)` and `ell^(2/3)` over `(0, t]` give the bounds on `E N_eld(0, t]`.
- **Corollary L2.**
  - `nu_cand - nu_eld = ell^(-1/3) int A_r (1 - p_r) / (3 k^(2/3))`.
  - On each cap box `1 - p_r <= Q^W(G_r^c) <= C_box r^3 = C_box ell / k`, so the difference is at most
    `ell^(2/3) sum_box C_box int_box A_r / (3 k^(5/3))`.
  - Theorem L bounds `A_r` by `(1 + a_up r_*^2 + eps) A_0^ref`.
  - Integrating over `(0, t]` gives (12.1) and (12.3).

## 2. The laws: Taylor models in `r` (Lemmas 1–2)

**Taylor models.** Each covariance of two preconditioned functionals is the exact series of [E] / [E3] section 2,
`sum_gamma kappa_gamma pi_gamma r^(g_x - w)`. Added to it are:
- the truncation tail beyond `g_x = 60`;
- the torus remainder, by Cauchy estimates on the polydisc: `M_1(10) < 4.46 x 10^-15` in the plane and `< 1.94 x 10^-13`
  in `d = 3`.

The certificate keeps each one on `[0, 1/64]` as a **Taylor model**:
- `f(r) = sum_{j <= 8} c_j r^j + theta e`, with `|theta| <= 1`;
- the coefficients are fixed-point integers with `288` fractional bits;
- every rounding, every truncated power `r^j <= 64^-j`, both tails and the torus remainder go into `e`.

Products, sums and reciprocals (a geometric series with an explicit tail) stay in this class. Gaussian elimination without
pivoting then gives Taylor models for the following, all exact in their polynomial parts up to `2^-288`:
- `det Sigma_r`;
- the pin energies `e_bb`, `e_bk`, `e_kk`, with `v_r' Sigma_r^-1 v_r = e_bb b^2 + 2 e_bk b k + e_kk k^2`;
- the regression coefficients `alpha` and `beta` (mean `= b alpha + k beta`) of the transverse Hessian `A = D_y^2 f(M)` and of
  `Omega' = (D_y^2 f(S) - D_y^2 f(M))/r`;
- their covariances;
- in `d = 3`, the regression matrix of `Omega'` on `B = -A`.

This removes the dependence loss of interval elimination. For example, the band laws of [E] give the `k`-coefficient of the
mean of `A` on `[0, r]` only as `+-3 r`, while the Taylor model gives `0` up to `10^-11`.

**Lemma 1 (the transverse Hessian is exactly contact-distributed).** For the reference kernel, every `r > 0`, every `b` and
every `k`, the `Q`-law of `A = D_y^2 f(M)` is that of `-b I_m + G`. Here `G` is the `GOE_m` of [G3], with `N(0, 2)` diagonal
and `N(0, 1)` off-diagonal entries; the law does not depend on `r` or `k`.

*Proof.* The kernel factorizes, `exp(-|z|^2/2) = exp(-x^2/2) exp(-|y|^2/2)`. Every pin is either axial (`partial_x^a f` on the
axis) or a first transverse derivative on the axis.
- For an axial functional `g`, `Cov(f_{y_i y_j}(x, 0), g) = -delta_ij Cov(f(x, 0), g)`, because
  `partial_{y_i} partial_{y_j} exp(-|y|^2/2) = -delta_ij` at `y = 0`.
- For a transverse pin, `Cov(f_{y_i y_j}(x, 0), f_{y_l}(x', 0)) = Cov(f(x, 0), f_{y_l}(x', 0)) = 0`, because odd
  `y`-derivatives of the kernel vanish at `y = 0`.

So `A + f(M) I` is uncorrelated with every pin, hence independent of all of them. Under `Q`, `f(M) = b`, so
`A = -b I + (A + f(M) I)` with `A + f(M) I` keeping its unconditional law:
- `Var(f_yy + f) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`;
- `Cov(f_{y_1 y_1} + f, f_{y_2 y_2} + f) = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0`;
- `Var f_{y_1 y_2} = 1`.

∎

The certificate checks Lemma 1 on the Taylor models:
- every polynomial coefficient of `alpha_A + 1`, `beta_A` and `Cov(A) - Cov(GOE)` vanishes to within `10^-60`;
- the code requires this, and only the remainder survives: at most `1.9 x 10^-12` in the plane and `8.1 x 10^-11` in `d = 3`.

So on the torus the law is the contact law up to these remainders.

**Lemma 2 (pin law, energies, `Omega'`).** For the reference kernel, the Taylor models give (coefficients exact up to
`2^-288`):

    d = 2:  det Sigma_r = 12 - 18 r^2 + 14.4 r^4 + O(r^6),       d = 3:  det Sigma_r = 12 - 24 r^2 + 25.4 r^4 + O(r^6),
    both:   e_bb = 3/2 + r^2/8 - r^4/96 + ...,   e_bk = -(3/4) r^3 + ...,   e_kk = 24 - 6 r^2 + (6/5) r^4 + ...

For `Omega'`:
- **Mean.** `alpha = 0`, and `beta = r^2` on the diagonal entries.
- **Covariance with the Hessian.**
  - Plane: `Cov(om, w) = -r + r^3/4`.
  - `d = 3`: `Cov(A_ii, O_ii) = -r + r^3/4` and `Cov(A_12, O_12) = -r/2 + r^3/8`; all other cross-covariances vanish.
  - Hence in `d = 3`, `E[Omega' | B] = mu_Omega + beta(r) (B - mu_B)` with `beta(r) = (r - r^3/4)/2 + ...`, the same scalar for
    all three entries.
- **Covariance.** `Var om = 2 - r^2/2 + r^4/12`; `Cov(O_11, O_22) = 0`; `Var O_12 = 1 - r^2/4 + ...`.

At `r = 0` this is the contact law of [LP] section 15:
- `det = 12 = det Cov(f, f_xx) det Cov(f_x, f_xxx) = 2 . 6`;
- the energy is `3b^2/2 + 24 k^2`, which gives `pi_0 ∝ exp(-3b^2/4 - 12 k^2)`.

## 3. The pin-density ratio

    pi_r / pi_0^ref = (12 Theta^n / det S_r)^(1/2) exp(-(E_r - E_0)/2),

with:
- `n = 2(d + 1)`;
- `S_r` the unnormalized pin covariance and `Theta in [1, 1 + theta_1(10)]` the kernel normalization;
- `E_r = Theta (e_bb b^2 + 2 e_bk b k + e_kk k^2)` and `E_0 = 3 b^2/2 + 24 k^2`.

The Taylor models give `det S_r - 12 in [d_lo r^2 - e, d_hi r^2 + e]`, and the same for each energy coefficient. On a box
`b in [b_0, b_1]`, `k in [k_0, k_1]` (`b, k >= 0`), `log(pi_r/pi_0^ref)` lies between

    -max(0, d_hi) r^2/24 - max(0, E_hi/2) r^2 - (remainders)    and    max(0, -d_lo) r^2 / (24 (1 - x_m)) + max(0, -E_lo/2) r^2 + (remainders),

using `log(1 + x) >= x/(1 + x)` and `log(1 + x) <= x`. The dominant genuine term is `+3 k^2 r^2` from `e_kk = 24 - 6 r^2`. At
`k = 2` this is `12 r^2`, the largest part of `a_up` in the plane.

## 4. The normalizer: exact expansion and the first-order cancellation (Lemma 3)

**Plane.** Use the notation of [E] section 1: `lambda = -w`, `c1 = 6k - rT`, `c2 = 6k + rT + r^2 tau`, `e = (r nu - v)^2`.
The typed event is `{c1 > 0, P1 > 0, P2 > 0}`, which lies inside `{lambda > 0}`, and on it `W_r = r^2 P1 P2`. Expanding
exactly,

    P1 P2 = c1 c2 lambda^2 - r c1 c2 lambda om + r^2 lambda xi + r^2 v^2 (c2 om - e),

    c1 c2 = 36 k^2 + r^2 kappa,        kappa = 6 k tau - T^2 - r T tau,
    xi    = 6k (r nu^2 - 2 nu v) - T (r^2 nu^2 - 2 r nu v + 2 v^2) - r tau v^2.

Three cancellations remove every first-order term:
- **In `c1 c2`.** The first-order parts of `c1` and `c2` cancel.
- **Between `P1` and `P2`.** The terms `r c1 lambda e` (from `P2`) and `-r c2 lambda v^2` (from `P1`) cancel, because
  `e - v^2 = r^2 nu^2 - 2 r nu v`.
- **The `om` term.** The remaining first-order term `-36 k^2 r E[lambda_+ om]` has an `O(r)` coefficient. Regress `om` on `w`:
  `om = om_g + bw (w - mu_w)` with `om_g` independent of `w`. Then

      E[lambda_+ om] = mu_om E[lambda_+] - bw (E[lambda_+^2] - mu_lambda E[lambda_+]),        mu_lambda = -mu_w,

  and Lemma 2 gives `mu_om = k r^2` and `bw = -r/2 + O(r^3)`.

So `Z_r / (36 k^2 r^2) = E[lambda_+^2] + O(r^2)`, and by Lemma 1 `E[lambda_+^2] = m_2(b)` exactly for the reference kernel.

The second-order terms are bounded by Hölder's inequality with the Gaussian norms of the band law of [E] on `[0, R]`. The one
exception is `kappa`. Since `E[tau | w] = mu_tau + bw_tau (w - mu_w)` with `mu_tau = -2k + O(r^2)`, the term
`6k E[tau lambda_+^2] = 6k mu_tau E[lambda_+^2] + ...` is negative. The certificate therefore bounds the `kappa` term with its
sign:
- above by `max(0, 6k mu_tau F + |side terms|)`;
- below by `6k mu_tau F - E[T^2 lambda_+^2] - |side terms|`.

**`d = 3`.** Write `D = det B` (`B = -A`), `A* = adj B`, `B_S = B - r Omega'`, and `e = r nu - v` (a vector). [E3] (I2) gives
`P1 = c1 D - r v' A* v` and `P2 = c2 det B_S + r e' adj(B_S) e`. In two dimensions `det B_S = D - r tr(A* Omega') + r^2 det Omega'`
and `adj(B_S) = A* - r adj(Omega')`, so

    P1 P2 = c1 c2 D^2 - r c1 c2 D tr(A* Omega') + r^2 c1 c2 D det Omega' + r^2 D xi_3 - r^2 c1 D e' adj(Omega') e
            + r^2 c2 tr(A* Omega') v' A* v - r^3 c2 det Omega' v' A* v - r^2 (v' A* v)(e' A* e) + r^3 (v' A* v)(e' adj(Omega') e),

    xi_3 = -(2T + r tau) v' A* v - 2 c1 nu' A* v + r c1 nu' A* nu.

Again `c1 e' A* e - c2 v' A* v = r xi_3`. The main term is `36 k^2 E[D^2 1{B > 0}]`, which equals `36 k^2 m_3(b)` for the
reference kernel (Lemma 1). On the torus the Loewner coupling of [E3] section 6 compares it with `m_3`, at the same `b` and with
shift `eps + 12 eta` (remainders only).

Four terms whose expectations are of lower order than their absolute values are treated through conditional expectations:
- **The first-order term `-36 k^2 r E[D tr(A* Omega') 1]`.** By Lemma 2, `E[Omega' | B] = mu_Omega + beta (B - mu_B) + DY`, so

      E[D tr(A* Omega') 1] = beta (2 E[D^2 1] - b E[D tr B 1]) + R_1,

  with `|R_1| <= ||mu_Omega|| E[D tr B 1] + ||DG|| ||D tr B 1||_2 (tr Cb)^(1/2)` (`DY = DG (B - mu_B)`, remainder only). Since
  `beta = r/2 + O(r^3)`, the term divided by `36 k^2 r^2` (its contribution to `Z_r / (36 k^2 r^2)`) is
  `-(1/2) r^2 (2 - b E[D tr B 1]/m_3) m_3 (1 + O(r))`; relative to the main term `m_3` it is
  `-(1/2) r^2 (2 - b E[D tr B 1]/m_3) (1 + O(r))` (OA-215-A-01). It is signed and enters `a_dn`, with only `O(r)` slack in
  `a_up`.
- **`r^2 E[c1 c2 D det Omega' 1]`.** `E[det Omega' | B] = det(E[Omega' | B]) + E[det X']`, where `X' = Omega' - E[Omega' | B]`
  is independent of `B`. Here `E[det X'] = Cov(X'_11, X'_22) - Var X'_12` is about `-1`, and `det(E[Omega' | B]) = O(r^2)`.
- **`r^2 E[c2 tr(A* Omega') v' A* v 1]` and `r^2 E[c1 D e' adj(Omega') e 1]`.** Condition on `zeta = (B, v, nu)`. Then
  `E[Omega' | zeta] = mu_Omega + Y_K`, and the explained part `Y_K` has `E||Y_K||^2 <= sum_O c_O' D^-1 c_O / (1 - ||E||)`, which is
  `O(r^2)`. So both terms are `O(r^3)`.
- **The `kappa` term**, with its sign as in the plane.

The moments of `B` are the closed-form contact moments `E[det^a tr^c 1{B > 0}]` at the shifted mean, plus outside-ball parts.

## 5. The thin typed shell (Lemma 4)

The typed event differs from `{lambda > 0}` (plane) or `{B > 0}` (`d = 3`) only where the smallest eigenvalue is `O(r)`. On
`G_0 = {r |T| <= 3k/2, r^2 |tau| <= 3k/2}` one has `c1 >= 9k/2` and `3k <= c2 <= 9k`.

**Plane.**
- `{lambda > 0}` minus the typed event lies in `{0 < lambda <= r h}`, with `h = 2 v^2/(9k) + |om|`.
- There `|P1 P2| <= r^2 (15 k h/2 + v^2)(9k (h + |om|) + e)`.
- Given `(v, om, nu)`, `lambda` is Gaussian. Its variance is at least `1/(1/Var w + bw' Cg^-1 bw)` (Schur complement), with
  `Cg^-1 <= D^-1/(1 - ||E||_F)` by diagonal scaling.
- So `E[G 1{0 < lambda <= r h}] <= r pbar E[G h]`, and the shell contributes `O(r^3)`.

**`d = 3`.**
- The shell is `{0 < lambda_1 <= r h}`, with `h = 2 ||v||^2/(9k) + ||Omega'||_F`.
- There `|P1 P2| <= r^2 lambda_2 (lambda_2 + r ||Omega'||)(15 k h/2 + ||v||^2)(9k (h + ||Omega'||) + ||e||^2)`.
- Given `Y = (v, Omega', nu)`, `B` is Gaussian with covariance `C' >= cl I`, where `1/cl <= 1/lambda_min(Cb) + ||Bt' Cg^-1 Bt||`.
- In eigenvalue coordinates (`dB = sqrt2 (lambda_2 - lambda_1) d lambda_1 d lambda_2 d theta`, `theta in [0, pi)`):

      E[lambda_2 (lambda_2 + r Omega) 1{0 < lambda_1 <= s} | Y] <= s KB' J(||mu'||, r Omega),

  where:
  - `KB' = pi sqrt2 (2 pi)^(-3/2) cl^(-3/2)`;
  - `J(m, x) = int_0^inf lambda^2 (lambda + x) exp(-(lambda - m)_+^2/(2 c_hi)) d lambda`, a polynomial in `m` and `x` built from
    half-Gaussian moments;
  - `||mu' - mu_B|| <= ||C_BY C_YY^(-1/2)|| chi_7`.
- The rows of `Bt` for `Omega'` come from the Taylor models and are `O(r)`; those for `v` and `nu` are below `10^-11`.

**Both.** The complement of `G_0` has probability below `10^-50` for `R <= 1/64`. It enters through
`||P1 P2||_2 P(G_0^c)^(1/2)`.

The sweep evaluates these bounds on `96` boxes (`b`-step `1/8`, `k`-step `1/8`) for each `R`. The box constants feed the
weighted `c'`; their maxima are Theorem L's `a_up` and `a_dn`.

## 6. Reference integrals

`A_0^ref / (3 k^p) = K_d k^(2-p) exp(-12 k^2) exp(-3b^2/4) m_d(b)`, with `K_d = |S^(d-1)| 144 (2 pi)^-(d+1) / sqrt12`.

**The `k`-integrals** are incomplete gamma functions,

    int_{k0}^{k1} k^q exp(-12 k^2) dk = (1/2) 12^(-(q+1)/2) [gamma((q+1)/2, 12 k1^2) - gamma((q+1)/2, 12 k0^2)],

with the powers `x^a` from exact integer roots and the series closed by a geometric tail.

**The `b`-integrals** use the composite midpoint rule on `4096` cells:
- the error per cell is at most `h^3 |g''|_max / 24`;
- `|g''|` is bounded per block of `16` cells through `m`, `m'`, `m''`, all increasing in `b`;
- plane: `m' = 2 E[(b + sqrt2 z)_+]` and `m'' = 2 Phi(b/sqrt2) <= 2`;
- `d = 3`: `m_3' = 2 E[det tr 1]` and `m_3'' = 2 E[tr^2 1] + 4 E[det 1]` (contact moments).

**Cross-checks** (exact, in the certificate): the enclosures of `c^ref_{B,K}` contain the values of Math-#197
(`0.0023869380211529483`, Owen-T closed form) and Math-#205 (`0.00097438236602425`).

## 7. The cap sweep and `C_{B,K}`

The cap route needs `sup_{r <= r_*} Q^W(G_r^c)/r^3` on boxes that resolve `k` near `1/2`. There the weight
`A_0^ref / k^(5/3) ∝ k^(1/3) e^(-12 k^2)` concentrates, and `c_G` grows like `k^3`.

The engines of [E] and [E3] (`box_bound`, with their first parameter pair `(X_0, theta)`) are run on:
- every band of [E] (`153`) and of [E3] (`121`);
- `56` boxes per band: `b`-boxes `[i/4, (i+1)/4]`, and `k`-boxes of width `1/32` on `[1/2, 3/4]`, width `1/16` on `[3/4, 1]`,
  then `[1, 3/2]` and `[3/2, 2]`.

The certified per-box bounds are stored to four decimals, rounded up. For each `r_*`, `C_box(r_*)` is the maximum over the bands
with `r_1 <= r_*`, and

    C_{B,K}(r_*) = (1 + a_up(r_*) r_*^2 + eps) sum_box C_box(r_*) |S^(d-1)| int_box A_0^ref / (3 k^(5/3)).

## 8. Arithmetic

- Exact rationals throughout.
- The Taylor models are fixed-point integers with explicit rounding.
- Interval enclosures of `exp`, `Phi` and the Gaussian and contact moments come from the engines.
- Fractional powers use integer `p`-th roots.
- Every stored number is rounded outward to a decimal and replayed exactly.

## 9. Controls (floating point; not part of the certificate)

**Monte Carlo of the genuine coefficient.** `theorem_b.py --controls` estimates `(A_r / A_0^ref - 1) / r^2` for the reference
kernel at `r = 1/8` and `1/16` and at the four corners of the band:
- the law at `r` comes from the exact series, which is valid at every `r` (the Taylor models stop at `1/64`);
- the pin ratio is exact;
- `Z_r / r^2` is sampled as `P1 P2 1{typed}` (seed `20261001`; `2 x 10^5` samples per point in the plane, `10^5` in `d = 3`).

Values are shown with one standard error:

| `d` | `r` | `(b, k) = (0, 1/2)` | `(0, 2)` | `(1, 1/2)` | `(1, 2)` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `2` | `1/8` | `0.08 ± 0.32` | `13.19 ± 0.39` | `0.64 ± 0.22` | `13.43 ± 0.26` |
| `2` | `1/16` | `0.16 ± 1.28` | `12.74 ± 1.34` | `1.09 ± 0.86` | `13.35 ± 0.90` |
| `3` | `1/8` | `2.24 ± 1.61` | `10.89 ± 1.75` | `0.84 ± 0.73` | `12.88 ± 0.87` |
| `3` | `1/16` | `-1.95 ± 5.71` | `17.29 ± 6.16` | `2.64 ± 2.99` | `17.45 ± 3.15` |

The certified `a_up` at `R = 1/4096` on the four corner boxes (`b`- and `k`-width `1/8`):

| `d` | `(0, 1/2)` | `(0, 2)` | `(1, 1/2)` | `(1, 2)` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `2` | `4.818760` | `13.822900` | `3.918911` | `13.742115` |
| `3` | `25.666574` | `16.876052` | `12.525134` | `14.762963` |

What the comparison shows:
- **Plane, `k = 2`.** The coefficient is `13.2`–`13.4`, and `a_up = 13.823` is attained here, about `4%` above it.
  - Most of `a_up` is the exact pin-density limit `12.75 r^2` (`0.75` from `det`, `12` from `e_kk`).
  - The `Z`-part is small and negative in the Monte Carlo (about `-0.7`); the certificate bounds it above by `1.07`.
- **Plane, `k = 1/2`.** The coefficient is `0.1`–`1.1`, against box constants `3.9`–`4.8`.
  - Here the `Z`-part is about `-0.8` to `-1.4`, while the certificate bounds it above by `2.0`–`2.9`.
  - This region carries most of the weight of `c'`, so `c'_up` is several times the genuine weighted coefficient.
- **`d = 3`.** At `k = 2` the coefficient is about `11`–`17`, against box constants `14.8`–`16.9`.
  - At `(0, 1/2)` the coefficient is about `0`–`2`, against the box constant `25.67`, which is the global `a_up`.
  - There `23.5` of that constant is the `Z`-part. It consists mostly of the Hölder bounds of `r^2 E[D xi_3 1]` (`13.9`) and
    `r^2 E[(v' A* v)(e' A* e) 1]` (`8.7`), relative to `36 k^2 m_3`.

**Reference-kernel cap-route benchmarks** (section 0). In floating point, `Gamma_{B,K} = |S^(d-1)| int A_0^ref c_G /
(3 k^(5/3))` is:
- `Gamma_2 = 307.51`, with the planar `c_G = R(b) J(k)` of [G] (`J(k) = 2359296 k^3 (1 + delta(k))`);
- `Gamma_3 = 540.97`, with the `d = 3` ratios of [G3].

So `C_{B,K}(1/4096)` is `1.31 Gamma_2` and `2.23 Gamma_3`. These are comparisons with the reference-kernel benchmark,
not with the exact cap-route limit of a finite torus.

## 10. What this does not do

- **`d = 2, 3` and the band `B x K` only.**
  - The method needs a compact `K` away from `0`; the shell bound uses `k >= 1/2`.
  - The unrestricted densities of [LP] Theorem C are not addressed. There the constant term `B_{d,L}` (Math-#191, Math-#211)
    comes from pairs this window excludes.
- **No vanishing-remainder rate on the torus.** The remainders `eps_d` and `eps'_d` depend on neither `r` nor `ell`.
  Theorem L and Corollary L1 are expansions about the reference contact integrand and constant. They give no rate for
  `A_r -> A_0`, nor for `ell^(1/3) nu -> c_{B,K}`, on the torus.
- **The Kac–Rice interface is consumed, not reviewed.** [LP] sections 8–12 are used as statements.
- **The cap route only for `C_{B,K}`.**
  - `C_{B,K}` bounds `nu_cand - nu_eld` through `1 - p_r <= Q^W(G_r^c)`.
  - By [G] the cap criterion overstates the pairing failure by `7.4 x 10^4` at `k = 1/2`, so the true difference coefficient
    is far smaller.
  - No lower bound for it is given.
- **Precision** (section 9).
  - In the plane `a_up` is within about `4%` at `k = 2`, where it is attained. Near `k = 1/2`, where most of the weight of
    `c'` lies, the box constants exceed the genuine coefficient by about `3`–`5`.
  - In `d = 3`, `a_up` and `a_dn` are attained near `(b, k) = (0, 1/2)`, where the genuine coefficient is about `0`–`2`. The
    excess comes from Hölder bounds of `r^2 E[D xi_3 1]` and `r^2 E[(v' A* v)(e' A* e) 1]`. These are large relative to
    `36 k^2 m_3` at small `k`, and conditional moments would sharpen them further.
  - At `k = 2` the `d = 3` box constants (`14.8`–`16.9`) are comparable to the Monte Carlo values (`11`–`17`).
- **Not a review** of [LP], [CAP], [E] or [E3]. The engines are used as certified box-bound and law functions; their
  correctness is the subject of Math-#206 and Math-#212.
- **Status.** C8 stays OPEN.

## 11. Verification

- `python3 -B -S theorem_b.py --check --procs N` replays exactly:
  - the Taylor-model laws and their recorded coefficients;
  - the rate sweep (`96` boxes, seven `R`, both dimensions);
  - the reference integrals and the cross-checks against Math-#197 and Math-#205;
  - a sample of the cap bands (the band ending at each `r_*`, at `2^-20`, and the last band);
  - the assembled tables.
- `--check` takes about 4 minutes on four cores.
- `--check-full` replays all `274` cap bands, in about 28 minutes on four cores.
- Mutants `no-om-term`, `no-bad-set`, `no-det`, `no-torus` and `cap-half` make the replay fail.
- The workflow checks:
  - the manifest;
  - the main-resident pins ([LP], [CAP]);
  - the engine copies against `SOURCE_MAP.json`;
  - `--check-full` and `--check` in the two interpreter modes;
  - the mutants;
  - a clean tree.
