## 0. Statement

Math-#207 ([CU], head `826b8be`, `PROOF.md` blob `f6df5a73`) proves, at candidate status, the second-order term of the
elder lifetime law, `nu_eld(ell) = c ell^(-1/3) + c1 ell^(1/4) + o(ell^(1/4))`, with

    c1 = -(192/7) 2^(1/4) integral_(S^(d-1)) integral_R pi_0(u; v_0(b,0)) E_0[ |Y|^(7/4) |Delta|^(1/4) 1{A < 0} | b ] db dsigma(u),     (CU.2)

where `Y = (f4/12) Delta - gamma^T adj(A) gamma/4` and `Delta = det A`, built from the zero-gap contact jets `f4 = d_u^4 f(0)`,
`gamma = grad_Theta d_u^2 f(0)` and `A = D_Theta^2 f(0)` ([CU] (0.1)). [CU] evaluates (CU.2) by floating quadrature and lists
certified numerics as not claimed. This packet certifies it.

**Theorem (certified enclosures).** For the Gaussian kernel `K(z) = exp(-|z|^2/2)` on `R^d`, the integral (CU.2) and the
candidate coefficient `I^cand = (3^(1/4)/2) c1` of [CU] (CU'.1) satisfy

| `d` | `c1` | `I^cand` | `I^cand - c1` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | `[-0.22760635877558, -0.22760635877504]` | `[-0.14977340698364, -0.14977340698328]` | `[0.077832951791707, 0.077832951791985]` |
| `2` | `[-0.269398825674, -0.269398825672]` | `[-0.177274396795, -0.177274396793]` | `[0.0921244288786, 0.0921244288791]` |
| `3` | `[-0.211848347, -0.211848346]` | `[-0.139404052, -0.139404051]` | `[0.0724442943, 0.0724442950]` |

With the leading coefficients `c_(d,ref)` of `coefficients/side24_v1` (1) ([SIDE24]), enclosed here from their closed
form,

| `d` | `c_(d,ref)` | `c1 / c_(d,ref)` |
|---|---|---|
| `2` | `[0.0734069193059, 0.0734069193062]` | `[-3.66993776909, -3.66993776907]` |
| `3` | `[0.0417759318405, 0.0417759318407]` | `[-5.07106215, -5.07106213]` |

**Corollary S (the [P] torus field; v1.1).** Let `L >= 24`, and let the field on `R^d/(L Z^d)` have covariance
`K_L(z) = sum_(n in Z^d) exp(-|z + L n|^2/2)`, normalized to variance one or not. In particular this covers SIDE24
(`L = 24`), the manuscript's field ([CU] §0). Then for `d = 2, 3` the coefficient (CU.2) of this field satisfies
`|c1^(L)/c1^(ref) - 1| <= eta_d`, with `eta_2 <= 5.9e-105` and `eta_3 <= 1.4e-104` (Lemma S, §3b). Hence

| `d` | `c1^(L)` | `I^cand,(L)` | `c1^(24) / c_(d,24)` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2` | `[-0.269398825674, -0.269398825672]` | `[-0.177274396795, -0.177274396793]` | `[-3.66993776909, -3.66993776907]` |
| `3` | `[-0.211848347, -0.211848346]` | `[-0.139404052, -0.139404051]` | `[-5.07106215, -5.07106213]` |

Here `c_(d,24)` is taken from `coefficients/side24_v1/ENCLOSURE.json` ([SIDE24-E], consumed): `c_(2,24)` in
`[0.07340691930603427103, 0.07340691930603427104]` and `c_(3,24)` in `[0.04177593184059834334, 0.04177593184059834335]`.

`RESULTS.json` holds the certificate's own intervals (16 digits, after widening by `1e-12` relative); the tables round them
further outward.

**Consequences.**
- **[CU]'s floating values are confirmed to all their digits.** [CU] §8 (remark 3) reports `c1 = -0.26939883` (`d = 2`)
  and `-0.21184835` (`d = 3`), `c = 0.0734069193` and `0.0417759318`, `c1/c = -3.669938` and `-5.071062`, and `I^cand`,
  `I^cand - c1` to seven digits. Each is the correct rounding of the certified midpoint (`controls.py`, §7). The `d = 3`
  referee Monte Carlo `-0.211848 +- 0.000024` is `0.01` standard errors from it.
- **The manuscript's correction ratio is certified.** For the manuscript's field (`d = 3`, `L = 24`) the relative
  correction of [CU] (CU.1) is `(c1/c) ell^(7/12)`, with `c1/c_(3,24)` in `[-5.07106215, -5.07106213]` (Corollary S). [CU] §0
  states `c1/c ~ -5.071` for this field.
- **`d = 1` is a closed form.** `c1^(1) = -(384/7) 2^(1/4) 12^(-9/4) (2 pi)^-2 sqrt(4 pi/3) 30^(7/8) 2^(7/8)
  Gamma(11/8)/sqrt(pi)`. It agrees with Math-#214's `C_1` (#216's table: `-0.227606`). As [CU]'s author notes (#207 comment
  5925314397), (CU.2) at `d = 1` is #214's coefficient.

## 1. What is evaluated

The integral (CU.2) as [CU] defines it.
- `E_0[. | b]` is the expectation over the contact jets under the zero-gap target `v_0(b, 0)`: `f(0) = b`,
  `d_u f(0) = d_u^2 f(0) = d_u^3 f(0) = 0`, `grad_Theta f(0) = grad_Theta d_u f(0) = 0`.
- `pi_0(u; v_0(b, 0))` is the density of those pins. By [LP] §15 and [CU] (CU.2) it factorizes as
  `pi_0 = p_(f, V_u)(b, 0) p_G(0) phi_tau(0)`, where `G = grad f(0)` and `V_u = H_f(0) u`.
- `d sigma` is the surface measure on `S^(d-1)`, with `|S^0| = 2`, `|S^1| = 2 pi`, `|S^2| = 4 pi`.

The kernel is `K(z) = exp(-|z|^2/2)`, which is isotropic, so the `u`-integral is `|S^(d-1)|` times the value at `u = e_1`.
`Cov(d^a f, d^b f) = (-1)^|b| d^(a+b) K(0)`, and `d^g K(0) = prod_i (-1)^(g_i/2) (g_i - 1)!!` for even `g`, 0 otherwise.

## 2. Reduction (Lemma R)

**R.1 (the zero-gap contact law).** Given the pins,
- `f4 ~ N(-3b, 24)`;
- `gamma ~ N(0, 2 I_(d-1))`;
- `A = -b I_(d-1) + G`, with `G` symmetric, `G_jj ~ N(0, 2)` and `G_jk ~ N(0, 1)` for `j < k`;
- all of these independent;
- `pi_0 = (2 pi)^(-(d+1)) 12^(-1/2) e^(-3b^2/4)`.

*Proof.*
- **Odd jets.** `(f_x, f_y, f_xxx, gamma)` are uncorrelated with the even jets (`K` is even).
  - Each `gamma_j = f_xxy_j` has variance 3 and covariance `-1` with `f_y_j`. Its covariances with `f_x`, `f_xxx` and the
    other `gamma`'s vanish, so given the pins its variance is `3 - 1 = 2`.
  - `tau^2 = Var(f_xxx | grad f = 0) = 15 - 9 = 6`, so `phi_tau(0) = (12 pi)^(-1/2)`, and `p_G(0) = (2 pi)^(-d/2)`.
- **Even jets.** `W = (f, f_xx, f_xy_j)` has covariance `[[1, -1], [-1, 3]] (+) I_(d-1)`, with
  `W^(-1)_(11) = 3/2` and determinant 2, so `p_W(b, 0) = (2 pi)^(-(d+1)/2) 2^(-1/2) e^(-3b^2/4)`.
  - Regression on `W = (b, 0, 0)` gives `E[f4] = (3, -15).(3/2, 1/2) b = -3b` and `Var f4 = 105 - 81 = 24`.
  - It gives `E[A_jj] = -b`, `Var A_jj = 3 - 1 = 2`, `Cov(A_jj, A_kk) = 1 - 1 = 0` and `Var A_jk = 1`.
  - It gives `Cov(f4, A_jj) = -3 - (-3) = 0`.
  - All other covariances vanish by parity of the individual indices.
- Multiplying the three factors gives `pi_0`. ∎

**R.2 (Mellin form).** For `0 < p < 2`, `|y|^p = K^(-1) integral_0^oo (1 - cos(omega y)) omega^(-1-p) d omega`, with
`K = pi/(2 Gamma(1+p) sin(pi p/2))`. At `p = 7/4`, `K = pi/(2 Gamma(11/4) sin(7 pi/8))`.

All integrands below are nonnegative before the real part is taken, so Tonelli applies. Hence
`E|Y|^(7/4) = K^(-1) integral (1 - Re E e^(i omega Y)) omega^(-11/4) d omega`.

**R.3 (`d = 1`).** Here `A` is empty and `Y = f4/12`. The `b`-weight `e^(-3b^2/4)` makes `f4` a centered normal of variance
`24 + 9 (2/3) = 30`. With `E|Z|^(7/4) = 2^(7/8) Gamma(11/8)/sqrt(pi)` this gives the closed form of §0.

**R.4 (`d = 2`).** On `A = -a < 0` we have `Delta = A` and `adj A = 1`.
- Given `(a, b)`, `(f4/12) A ~ N(ab/4, a^2/6)` and `E e^(-i omega gamma^2/4) = (1 + i omega)^(-1/2)`.
- The `b`-weight `pi_0 phi_(-b,2)(-a)` equals `(2 pi)^-3 12^(-1/2) (4 pi)^(-1/2) e^(-3a^2/16) e^(-(b - a/4)^2)`, and
  `integral db` gives the factor `sqrt(pi) e^(i omega a^2/16 - omega^2 a^2/64)`.
- Then `integral_0^oo a^(1/4) e^(-beta a^2) da = Gamma(5/8)/(2 beta^(5/8))`, for `Re beta > 0` and the principal power,
  with `beta(omega) = 3/16 - i omega/16 + 19 omega^2/192`.
- Hence
      c1^(2) = -(192/7) 2^(1/4) (2 pi)^-2 12^(-1/2) Gamma(5/8) K^(-1)/4 . J,
      J = integral_0^oo omega^(-11/4) [ beta(0)^(-5/8) - Re((1 + i omega)^(-1/2) beta(omega)^(-5/8)) ] d omega.
- With `omega = u^4`, `beta = (3/16)(1 - i omega/3 + 19 omega^2/36)` and `C0 = (3/16)^(-5/8)`, we get
  `J = 4 C0 integral_0^oo g2(u) du`, where `g2(u) = (1 - Re H(u^4))/u^8` and
  `H(omega) = (1 + i omega)^(-1/2)(1 - i omega/3 + 19 omega^2/36)^(-5/8)`.

**R.5 (`d = 3`).**
- `A < 0` has eigenvalues `-a1 <= -a2 < 0`. The laws of `G` and `gamma` are rotation invariant.
- On `2 x 2` symmetric matrices `dA = |lambda_1 - lambda_2| d lambda_1 d lambda_2 d theta` (the Jacobian is exactly
  `|lambda_1 - lambda_2|`), with `theta` in `[0, pi)`, so `integral_(A<0) dA = pi integral_(a1>a2>0) (a1 - a2) da1 da2`.
- In the eigenframe `gamma^T adj(A) gamma = -(a2 gamma1^2 + a1 gamma2^2)`. Given `(A, b)`,
      E e^(i omega Y) = e^(-i omega b a1 a2/4 - omega^2 (a1 a2)^2/12) (1 - i omega a1)^(-1/2) (1 - i omega a2)^(-1/2).
- The `b`-weight is `e^(-(5/4)(b - S/5)^2 + S^2/20 - (a1^2 + a2^2)/4)`, with `S = a1 + a2`, so `integral db` gives
  `sqrt(4 pi/5) e^(S^2/20 - (a1^2 + a2^2)/4) e^(-i omega a1 a2 S/20 - omega^2 (a1 a2)^2/80)`. Hence
      c1^(3) = -(192/7) 2^(1/4) 4 pi (2 pi)^(-11/2) 12^(-1/2) (1/2) sqrt(4 pi/5) pi K^(-1) T3,
      Phi(omega) = (1 - i omega a1)^(-1/2) (1 - i omega a2)^(-1/2) exp(-i omega a1 a2 (a1 + a2)/20 - 23 omega^2 (a1 a2)^2/240).
- Normalize by `a1 = s^4`, `a2 = a1 v^4` and `omega = t^4/a1`. Then `da1 da2 = 16 s^7 v^3 ds dv` and
  `omega^(-11/4) d omega = 4 a1^(7/4) t^(-8) dt`, and
      T3 = 64 integral_0^oo ds integral_0^1 dv integral_0^oo dt  s^20 v^4 (1 - v^4) e^(-s^8 E(v)) Gt,
      E(v) = (2v^8 - v^4 + 2)/10 >= 3/16,     Gt = (1 - Re Phi)/t^8.

**R.6 (safe form).**
- Write `R = Re log Phi` and `I = Im log Phi`. Then `1 - Re Phi = -expm1(R) + e^R 2 sin^2(I/2)`. With
  `E1(x) = expm1(x)/x`, `L(x) = log1p(x)/x`, `A(x) = atan(x)/x` and `Sinc(x) = sin(x)/x`,
      Rt = -(1/4)(L(t^8) + v^8 L(t^8 v^8)) - 23 a1^2 v^8/240,      It = (1/2)(A(t^4) + v^4 A(t^4 v^4)) - a1^2 v^4 (1 + v^4)/20,
      Gt = -E1(t^8 Rt) Rt + e^(t^8 Rt) Sinc(t^4 It/2)^2 It^2/2.
- `g2` is the same with `R/omega^2 = -(1/4)L(omega^2) - (5/16) q L(omega^2 q)`, `q = 7/6 + 361 omega^2/1296`, and
  `I/omega = -(1/2)A(omega) + (5/8)A(omega/v)/v`, `v = 3 + 19 omega^2/12`.
- No step divides by a small quantity, so the near-zero cancellation of `1 - Re Phi` is exact.
- `cusp.py` writes both integrands once, against real-interval and complex-box operations.

## 3. Rigorous quadrature

**Lemma Q (Gauss–Legendre on an ellipse).** Let `f` be analytic in the open Bernstein ellipse `c + h E_rho` of `[a, b]`
(`h = (b - a)/2`) with `|f| <= M` there. Then
    |integral_a^b f - Q_n f| <= h . 4 M (1 + 1/(4n^2 - 1)) rho^(-2n) / (1 - rho^(-2)).
*Proof.*
- On `[-1, 1]` the Chebyshev coefficients satisfy `|a_k| <= 2 M rho^(-k)`.
- `Q_n` is exact up to degree `2n - 1`, and exact on odd `T_k` by symmetry.
- For even `k`, `|integral T_k| <= 2/(k^2 - 1)` and `|Q_n T_k| <= sum w = 2`.
- Summing over `k >= 2n` gives the bound. ∎

The nodes are certified in exact rational arithmetic (`gauss.py`):
- Newton steps on the grid `2^-200`, then a strict sign change of `P_n` at `r -+ 2^-150`.
- The weights `2(1 - x^2)/(n P_(n-1)(x))^2` are enclosed by an exact midpoint value plus a Lipschitz term.
- Nodes are one ulp wide and weights are tight to `2e-16` relative.

**Lemma A (certifying analyticity).**
- The bound `M` is taken over complex boxes covering the closed ellipse: slabs along the real axis, and in `d = 3` real
  sub-intervals of the other variables.
- There are two representations:
  - the safe form of R.6, with the integral-hull enclosures `E1(z) = int e^(tau z)`, `L(z) = int (1 + tau z)^-1`,
    `A(z) = int (1 + tau^2 z^2)^-1`, `Sinc(z) = int cos(tau z)`, or their closed forms for `|z| >= 1` (`cx.py`);
  - the direct form `(1 - (Phi + Phi*)/2)/t^8`, bounded through `|z^a| = |z|^a`, where every base of a principal power must
    avoid `(-oo, 0]`.
- A representation that evaluates without exception on a box is analytic on a neighbourhood of it: every denominator and
  every logarithm or power argument has been checked away from its singular set.
- Every slab meets the real axis in a segment where the representation equals the integrand. By the identity theorem it is
  the integrand's analytic continuation on that slab.
- The bound is therefore valid even when different slabs use different representations.

**Lemma B (`d = 3` boxes).**
- The `(s, t)`-plane up to `s <= 3`, `t <= 15` is cut into 247 boxes. The `s`- and `v`-breakpoints include `c/t` near
  the origin, because for large `t` the integrand has branch points at `|v| = 1/t` and grows for `arg s > pi/16`.
- `v` is innermost. On a box `S x T`,
  `|I - Q| <= |(I_S - Q_S) I_T I_V f| + |Q_S (I_T - Q_T) I_V f| + |Q_S Q_T (I_V - Q_V) f|`. Each term takes Lemma Q in its
  own variable, with the other variables real, and the positive weights summing to `|S|` and `|T|`.
- Since `f3 >= 0`, a box is enclosed by `[0, volume . sup f3]` when that is below `1e-12` (76 boxes). The other
  171 use Gauss–Legendre (1406081 nodes), each to `1e-11`.
- **Tails.**
  - For `t > 15`, `integral = wgt (15^-7/7 + theta 15^-9/9)` with `|theta| <= 1`, since `|Phi| <= t^-2` on the real axis.
    The `s`-integral `integral s^20 e^(-s^8 E) ds = Gamma(21/8)/(8 E^(21/8))` is exact.
  - For `s > 3`, `Gt <= min(E[Y^2]/(2 a1^2), 2 t^-8)` gives less than `1e-280`.
- In `d = 2`, 15 `u`-panels up to `u = 15` are each taken to `5e-16`. The tail is
  `15^-7/7 +- 1.5 . 15^-14/14`, since `|Re H(u^4)| <= (36/19)^(5/8) u^-7`.

## 3b. The [P] torus field (Lemma S)

**Lemma S.** Let `d in {2, 3}` and `L >= 24`, let `C_L` be the covariance of the `N` jets of (CU.2) for the [P] field in an
orthonormal frame `(u, Theta)`, and let `C_0` be that of the Gaussian kernel. Here `N = 9` in `d = 2` and `N = 14` in `d = 3`,
counting the `2d + 2` pinned coordinates `(f, d_u f, d_u^2 f, d_u^3 f, grad_Theta f, grad_Theta d_u f)` and the free
`(f4, gamma, A)`. Then `(1 - eps) C_0 <= C_L <= (1 + eps) C_0` in every frame, with `eps = N E/mu`, and
`|c1^(L)/c1^(ref) - 1| <= eta = 8 M eps`, `M = N/2 + 1`.

*Proof.*
- **S.1 (image bound).** Every covariance entry is `(-1)^|b| D^(|a|+|b|) K(0)` contracted with frame vectors, of total
  order `q <= 8` (`Cov(f4, f4) = d_u^8 K(0)`).
  - For unit `v_i`, `D^q phi(x)[v]` is `phi(x)` times a sum over the partial matchings of `{1..q}` of products of
    `-<v_i, v_j>` and `-<x, v_i>`. So `|D^q phi(x)[v]| <= T_8 |x|^8 phi(x)` for `|x| >= 1`, with `T_8 = 764` matchings, and
    `<= 7!! = 105` at `x = 0`.
  - For `d <= 3` the shell `max|n_i| = j` has at most `27 j^3` points, with `|n|^2 <= 3 j^2`. Consecutive shell terms
    shrink by at least `1/2`, so `sum_(n != 0) |n|^8 e^(-288|n|^2) <= 4374 e^(-288)` and `S_24 - 1 <= 54 e^(-288)`.
  - `e^(288/125) > 10` by the positive Taylor sum through 20 terms, so `e^(-288) < 10^-125`.
  - `L^8 e^(-L^2 |n|^2/2)` decreases in `L` once `L|n| >= 3`, so the bound at `L = 24` holds for every `L >= 24`.
  - Writing `D^q K_L(0) - D^q phi(0) = S_L^-1 sum_(n != 0) D^q phi(L n) + D^q phi(0)(S_L^-1 - 1)`, every entry of
    `C_L - C_0` is at most `E = (764 . 24^8 . 4374 + 105 . 54) 10^-125 <= 3.7e-108` in absolute value. The
    unnormalized periodization has only the first term.
- **S.2 (sandwich).** `C_0 - I/4` is positive definite: an exact `LDL^T` has all pivots positive, and `lambda_min(C_0)` is
  about `0.258` in `d = 3`. So `|x^T (C_L - C_0) x| <= N E |x|^2 <= eps x^T C_0 x`.
- **S.3 (transfer).** Write the (CU.2) integral at direction `u` as
  `I_u(C) = integral db integral dW F(W) phi_C(b, 0, W)`, with `F = |Y|^(7/4) |Delta|^(1/4) 1{A < 0} >= 0` and `2d + 1`
  coordinates fixed at 0. (`pi_0 E_0[F | b]` is exactly this slice integral of the joint density.)
  - `F` is homogeneous of degree `2d - 1/4` in the free jets: `Y` has degree `d` and `Delta` degree `d - 1`.
    Substituting `(b, W) -> sqrt(a) (b, W)` therefore gives `I_u(a C_0) = a^(-5/8) I_u(C_0)`.
  - From `(1 - eps) C_0 <= C <= (1 + eps) C_0`: `det C >= (1 - eps)^N det C_0` and `C^-1 >= C_0^-1/(1 + eps)`, and
    symmetrically `det C <= (1 + eps)^N det C_0` and `C^-1 <= C_0^-1/(1 - eps)`. This gives the pointwise sandwich

        [(1 - eps)/(1 + eps)]^(N/2) phi_((1-eps) C_0) <= phi_C <= [(1 + eps)/(1 - eps)]^(N/2) phi_((1+eps) C_0).

  - Integrating the nonnegative `F` gives `I_u(C_L) / I_u(C_0)` in `[rho^-M, rho^M]`, with `rho = (1 + eps)/(1 - eps)`.
  - `log rho <= 4 eps` and `e^x <= 1 + 2x` on `[0, 1]`, so this lies within `8 M eps` of 1.
  - `I_u(C_0)` does not depend on `u` (isotropy), so integrating over `S^(d-1)` preserves the bound. ∎

The constants, as exact rationals in `RESULTS.json` (`rules`), are as follows:

| `d` | `N` | `mu` | `eps` | `eta` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `2` | `9` | `1/4` | `<= 1.4e-106` | `<= 5.9e-105` |
| `3` | `14` | `1/4` | `<= 2.1e-106` | `<= 1.4e-104` |

In binary64 the factor `[1 - eta, 1 + eta]` is enclosed by the one-ulp interval around 1.

**Cross-check of Lemma R.1.** The self-test builds `C_0` exactly and regresses the free jets on the pins in rational
arithmetic. The result must reproduce R.1 exactly:
- `E[f4 | b] = -3b`, `Var = 24`;
- `gamma ~ N(0, 2 I)`;
- `E[A_jj | b] = -b`, `Var A_jj = 2`, `Var A_jk = 1`;
- all cross-covariances 0;
- `det C_P = 12` and `(C_P^-1)_ff = 3/2`, which is `pi_0 = (2 pi)^(-(d+1)) 12^(-1/2) e^(-3b^2/4)`.

## 4. Arithmetic

- **`ia.py`** is byte-identical to Math-#217's (`frontiers/c8_elder_failure_coefficient_20261001/ia.py`). It provides
  binary64 with one-ulp outward rounding, `pi` and `ln 2` from exact rational series, and `exp(-y)` with an a priori Taylor
  bound.
- **`elem.py`** adds `log`/`log1p` (`2 atanh` series), `atan` (two halvings plus the alternating series), `sin`/`cos`
  (reduction mod `pi/2`, alternating series; interval ranges include `+-1` at enclosed critical points), and the four
  kernels with their monotonicity.
- **`consts.py`** computes `log Gamma` by Stirling's series at `q + 10`, with the remainder bounded by the first omitted
  term, together with the exact rational product `prod (q + j)`.
- No libm transcendental is trusted.
- **Results are rounded outward.**
  - Both representations of each bound are reduced to a single float.
  - Every sum is an interval sum.
  - `RESULTS.json` widens by `1e-12` relative and rounds outward to 16 digits.
- `--check` recomputes everything. It requires each recomputed interval to lie inside the published one, and the published
  one to be at most `3e-12` relatively looser. It also requires identical rule data (panels, box counts, node counts).

`d = 2` panel rules, as `[a, b, n, rho]`: [0, 0.4, 13, 4], [0.4, 0.7, 13, 4], [0.7, 0.9, 14, 4], [0.9, 1, 13, 4], [1, 1.1, 13, 4], [1.1, 1.3, 13, 4], [1.3, 1.6, 16, 3], [1.6, 2, 15, 3], [2, 2.6, 15, 3], [2.6, 3.4, 14, 3], [3.4, 4.5, 13, 3], [4.5, 6, 15, 2.4], [6, 8, 14, 2.4], [8, 11, 13, 2.4], [11, 15, 11, 2.4].

## 6. Verification

`python3 -B -S certificate.py --check --procs N` runs a self-test, recomputes everything (about 4 minutes on four cores)
and compares the result with `RESULTS.json`.

The self-test checks:
1. Gauss–Legendre exactness on even monomials for `n = 4 ... 48`.
2. The real-interval safe forms against the direct complex-power formulas, in floating point, at ten points.
3. A deliberately coarse 6-point rule on `[0.85, 1.15]`, whose certified enclosure must contain a 40-point floating
   reference. This checks the error bound itself.
4. The `t`-tail against its floating formula.
5. Lemma S: the exact regression of R.1 (§3b), the image-bound order against the largest covariance order, `T_8 = 764`,
   the positive definiteness of `C_0 - I/4`, and the transcription of `c_(d,24)` against the repository copy of
   `ENCLOSURE.json` (when reachable).

The assembly also compares `integral g2` and `T3` with coarse floating quadratures of the safe form in libm floating
point. This guards normalizations and factors.

Six seeded defects must each be rejected by the self-test (exit 1):
- `kernel-A`: a `1e-7` change in `A`;
- `gl-weight`: weights `x (1 + 1e-9)`;
- `bound-scale`: error bounds `x 1e-6`;
- `phase-sign`: the sign of the `a1^2` phase term in `f3`;
- `tail-drop`;
- `image-order6`: an image bound valid only to order 6, as in side24_v1 §2, which is too low for `Cov(f4, f4)`.

The workflow `.github/workflows/cusp-coefficient-certified.yml` runs, for `-B -S` and `-B -O -S`: the manifest and pin
check, `--check`, the six mutants, and a clean-tree check.

## 7. Floating controls (`controls.py`; not part of the certificate)

These recompute the same quantities in libm floating point by routes that share only the Gauss–Legendre nodes
(`gauss.py`) with the certificate. They guard against a wrong reduction, not against rounding.

1. **`d = 2` without the Mellin identity.** Given `(a = -A, gamma, b)`, `Y` is Gaussian with standard deviation `a/sqrt 6`
   and mean `(ab - gamma^2)/4`, so `E|Y|^(7/4)` is a Kummer function. Averaging over `b` leaves a 2D integral over
   `(a, gamma)`, done by a product Gauss rule. Result: `-0.269398825672854`, `3.5e-15` from the certified midpoint.
2. **`d = 3` by the same route.** The eigenvalues `a1 > a2` of `-A`, the Vandermonde factor and `gamma ~ N(0, 2 I)` give a
   4D integral. Result: `-0.211848346210999`, `3.8e-13` from the certified midpoint.

   Both controls lie inside the certified intervals.
3. **The sources' quoted values.** Each is the correct rounding of the certified midpoint: the difference is below half a
   unit in its last digit.

[CU]'s three `d = 3` Monte Carlo runs (§8, remark 3), against the certified value:
- shipped fixed-seed: `-0.211630 +- 0.000140` (`+1.56` standard errors);
- development (`2e8` samples): `-0.211880 +- 0.000100` (`-0.32` standard errors);
- referee (`5e8` samples): `-0.211848 +- 0.000024` (`+0.01` standard errors).

4. **Lemma S, actual deviations.** A direct floating lattice sum over `|n_i| <= 2` computes the deviations
   `D^g K_24(0) - D^g phi(0)` of all jet covariance entries (`d = 3`, standard frame, variance-one normalization). The
   largest is `1.756e-114`, at `g = (8, 0, 0)`, the `d_u^8` entry `Cov(f4, f4)`. The certified entry bound is
   `E = 3.678e-108`, which exceeds it by a factor of about `2e6`.

## 8. What this does not do

- **Sides `L >= 24` only.**
  - For `L < 24` the premises of S.1 are not established, and no torus statement is made.
  - `d = 1` is the Gaussian kernel only.
  - The ratios `c1/c_(d,24)` consume side24_v1's enclosures of `c_(d,24)`. These are author-side (OpenAI), with
    nonauthor review open; they are not reviewed here.
- **Not a review of Theorem CU.** The numbers are the integral (CU.2) defines. That `c1` is the coefficient of
  `ell^(1/4)` in `nu_eld` is [CU]'s statement (author-side; it depends on Math-#191 and Math-#198), consumed, not
  reviewed.
- No `c2` (Math-#216), no `d >= 4`, no rate.
- Same GitHub account as every lane; zero organizational-independence credit. **I will not merge.**

## 9. Provenance

- **Sources** (`SOURCE_MAP.json`):
  - [CU] Math-#207 `frontiers/cusp_second_order_20261001/PROOF.md` at head `826b8be` (blob `f6df5a73`, unmerged; recorded,
