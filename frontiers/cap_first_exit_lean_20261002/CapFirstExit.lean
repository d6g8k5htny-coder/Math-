  CapFirstExit: the topological step from a separating cap to the global elder level.

  `CapHyp f C M z b s` bundles the conclusions that CAP §§2–5 derive from the local good event
  `G_r` (reviews/d1_cap_elder_partner_second_pass_claude_20260930/REVIEW.md, L16–L20):

  (C1) `M ∈ C` and `f ≤ b` on the cap `C`                                   (L16);
  (C2) `f ≤ s` on the whole frontier of `C`                                  (L17–L19);
  (C3) `b < f z`, and a path from `M` to `z` along which `f ≥ s`             (L17, L20).

  The saddle form adds (C2⁺): every frontier point other than `S` has `f < s`   (L19).

  Nothing is assumed about `f` outside `C` beyond the witness path in (C3). The core theorems use
  no metric, smoothness, Morse, compactness or probabilistic hypothesis, and their separation
  statements do not even use continuity of `f`. `X` is an arbitrary topological space; the torus
  is one instance. Only the older-peak theorems add compactness, local connectedness and
  continuity of `f`, all of which hold on the torus.

  Up to v1.8 the analytic steps L6 and L9–L12 (the `w'` bound and the quantitative `‖h'‖` and `F''`
  bounds) entered `ridge_capHyp_H1` as `hconv`. L1–L5, L7 (existence,
  uniqueness and implicit-function regularity of the ridge `h`: `ridge_exists`,
  `ridge_differentiable`), L8, L11's chain rule, L13 and L16–L20 are proved, and since v1.8
  `ridge_capHyp_source` composes them from source data on a collar `[-2r - ε, 2r + ε]` of `D`
  (the source data themselves are hypotheses). Since v1.9, L6 and L9–L12 are proved too, and
  `ridge_capHyp_C3` derives `hconv`; since v2.0 `ridge_capHyp_C4` also derives SP's
  `f_xxx ≥ 7/4` (L4, from L2's second statement and (H2)). Since v2.1 `ridge_capHyp_C5` derives
  the six derivative bounds from the block bound and `|f_xxx| ≤ m` on the pin segment, and
  `ridge_capHyp_D` assumes SP's quantitative bounds on `D` only (the continuity step to the collar
  is proved). Since v2.2 `ridge_capHyp_E` assumes only `f ∈ C⁴` on an open neighbourhood of `D`
  and SP's quantitative bounds on `D`: it builds every derivative datum from `f`, and the collar
  and its bound `K` come from compactness.
  `quarticToy_E` (v2.3) exercises it away from the degenerate face, with `D⁴f ≠ 0` and (H2) sharp.
  Since v2.4 `ridge_capHyp_K` states the cap on P §7's event `G_r` for every pin gap
  `f(M) − f(S) = k r³` with `k > 0`, namely `(4/(3k)) r m² < λ` and `r n ≤ 3k/10`, by rescaling
  `f ↦ f/(6k)` (`ridge_capHyp_E` is the case `k = 1/6`). `ridge_capHyp_norm_K` takes the bounds as
  operator norms `‖D³f‖ ≤ M3`, `‖D⁴f‖ ≤ M4` on `D`.
  Since v2.5 `ridge_capHyp_blocks` takes CAP (1) as written, with CAP's partial-block norms: the
  block inequality for `D³f` is derived from the partial blocks (`block_of_partial`), using the
  symmetry of `D³f` for `f ∈ C³` (`iteratedFDeriv_three_swap₁₂`, `iteratedFDeriv_three_swap₂₃`).
  `mixedToy_blocks` exercises it with a nonzero mixed block `∂_x D_y² f = 2`.
  Also not formalized: the
  identification of the H0 persistence pairing with the elder rule (L22, P §8); the
  unstable-branch analysis (L23); and every probabilistic statement.

/-! ### From the ridge to the cap hypotheses (L13, L16, L17, L19, L20)

SP §2 normalizes the pins to `x = a = -r/2` and `x = c = r/2`, on the cap
`C = [-2r, r/2] × B̄(0, 2r)` in coordinates `(x, y) ∈ ℝ × E`. The multi-variable analytic steps
enter as hypotheses, each the output of a named step of SP:
- `hT` (L7): on the cap, `f (x, y) ≤ f (x, h x)`, with `h` the transverse maximizer;
- `hg` (L11): the ridge function `g x = f (x, h x)` has derivative `F x`;
- `hFa`, `hFc` (L13): `F a = F c = 0`, because the pins are critical;
- `hconv` (L12): `F - q` is convex, where `q x = (x - a)(x - c)/8`; this is SP's `F'' ≥ 1/4`;
- `hside` (L18): on the curved side, `f ≤ g c`;
- `hgap`: `g a - g c < 9r³/32`. SP's normalization `g a - g c = r³/6` satisfies it.

From these inputs Lean derives the rest:
- L13: the sign pattern of `F`;
- L16: the ceiling `g ≤ g a` on `[-2r, c]`;
- L17: both exact face integrals `9r³/32`, by comparing `g` with the cubic
  `Q x = x³/24 - r²x/32`;
- L19: the face assembly;
- L20: the ridge path. -/

/-! ### The transverse slices (L7, L8, L11, L18)

`ridge_capHyp` takes the transverse maximum (`hT`), its uniqueness (`hTs`), the curved side
(`hside`) and the ridge equation `g' = F` as inputs. SP derives them deterministically from L4
(each slice `y ↦ f (x, y)` is `δ`-strongly concave on `B̄(0, 2r)`), L5 (the transverse derivative
`w x` at `y = 0` has norm at most `ω`) and the ridge equation `∂_y f (x, h x) = 0`. This section
proves those derivations. -/

/-- **L1 (the Hermite identity, as a bound).** If `g' = G` on `[a, c]`, `G` vanishes at both ends
(the pins are critical) and `|G''| ≤ m` in the weak form, then `g(a) - g(c) ≤ m (c - a)³/12`.
SP's identity `g(c) - g(a) = -(1/2)∫ φ g'''` with `∫ φ = (c - a)³/6` gives the same bound; here it
comes from `two_node_bound` and monotonicity of `g + (m/2)Φ`, `Φ' = (t - a)(c - t)`. -/

/-! ### The full domain (v1.8)

SP proves L4 on all of `D`, where the increment from `M` is at most `9r/2 < 5r`, and assumes
`f ∈ C⁴` near `D`. The lemmas below take the source data on a collar `x ∈ [-2r - ε, 2r + ε]`,
`0 < ε ≤ r/2`, where `|x + r/2| ≤ 3r` keeps the increment at most `5r`. So every slice over the open
set `(-2r - ε, 2r + ε) ⊇ [-2r, 2r]` is `(λ - 5rm)`-strongly concave, which is what the L7 lemmas
need, and `ridge_capHyp_source` composes L7 with the cap. -/

/-- **The cap from SP's source data (L1–L5, L7, L8, L11, L18 composed).** Fix a collar
`0 < ε ≤ r/2` and assume, for `x ∈ [-2r - ε, 2r + ε]` and `y ∈ B̄(0, 2r)`: a joint derivative `Df` of `f`, strictly differentiable in
its transverse part `∂_y f = Df ∘ inr` with derivative `DG`; the transverse Hessian `H` with the
third-derivative bounds `m` of L3; (H1) `8rm² < λ` with `H(M) ≤ -λ`; the critical pins
`Df(∓r/2, 0) = 0`; the weak bounds `|∂_x³ f(·, 0)| ≤ m` on `[-r/2, r/2]` (L1) and
`|∂_x² ∂_y f(·, 0)| ≤ m` on the collar (L5); and the gap `f(M) - f(S) = r³/6`. Then:
- a ridge `h` exists: on `(-2r - ε, 2r + ε)`, `h x` is a critical point of its slice in the open
  ball;
- for any such ridge (unique by `slice_critical_unique`) with L12's `hconv` for
  `F x = ∂_x f(x, h x)`, `h(∓r/2) = 0`, and (C1)–(C3) and (C2⁺) hold on the cap with `M = (-r/2, 0)`,
  `S = (r/2, 0)`, `b = f(M)` and `s = f(S)`.

L8 puts `h` in the open ball on `[-2r, 2r]` (`‖w‖ ≤ 3mr² < 2rδ`); the implicit function theorem
(`ridge_differentiable`) makes `h` differentiable there, with negative definite `DG ∘ inr = H`;
`ridge_inputs_of_joint` gives L11; `ridge_capHyp_H1` gives the cap. Only L12 (`hconv`) remains an
input, with L6 and L9–L11's quantitative bounds that SP uses to prove it. -/

/-! ### L6, L9 and L12 (v1.9)

The last analytic input of the cap, L12's convexity `hconv`, is derived here. L6 bounds `w'` by
chord slopes of L5's convexity pair (no integral), L9 bounds `h'` through the differentiated ridge
equation, and L12 uses that `F' = D²f[(1, h'), (1, 0)]` is the maximum of `ζ ↦ D²f[(1, ζ), (1, ζ)]`,
so that no second derivative of `h` is needed. `ridge_capHyp_C3` composes them with
`ridge_capHyp_source`. -/

`ridge_capHyp_source`, with L12's `hconv` derived instead of assumed. Additionally assume, on the
collar: a second derivative `D2f` of `f`, third derivatives `T3 p a b` of `p ↦ D²f p [a, b]`, every
third-derivative block other than `f_xxx` of norm at most `m` (combined form), and `f_xxx ≥ 7/4` on
`D = [-2r, 2r] × B̄(0, 2r)` (SP's L4, from L2 and (H2), on SP's domain). Then the ridge exists, and every ridge has `h(∓r/2) = 0` and yields
(C1)–(C3) and (C2⁺) on the cap. Inside: L5 gives `‖w‖ ≤ 2mr²` on `[-2r, 2r]`, L8 `‖h‖ ≤ 2mr²/δ`, L6
`‖w'‖ ≤ 2mr`, L3 in `y` `‖∂_x∇_y f(x, h)‖ ≤ ‖w'‖ + m‖h‖`, L9 `‖h'‖ ≤ 2s + 2s²` with `s = mr/δ`,
`trilinear_lower` and `l12_constants` give `F'' ≥ 1/4` in the form of `ridge_hconv`. -/

/-! ### L2's second statement and (H2) (v2.0)

SP's L4 lower bound `f_xxx ≥ 7/4` was the last analytic hypothesis of `ridge_capHyp_C3`. It follows
from the normalization (some point of the pin interval has `f_xxx ≥ 2`, by a one-sided Hermite bound)
and (H2) `rn ≤ 1/20` with a bound `n` on the derivative of `f_xxx`. `ridge_capHyp_C4` takes SP's
hypotheses only. -/

/-! ### The derivative bounds from the block bound, and SP's bounds on `D` (v2.1)

Up to v2.0 the capstones took six derivative bounds besides the block bound `hT`:
- `hHxb` and `hHrb`, the inputs of L3;
- `hwcv` and `hwcc`, the envelope inputs of L5–L6;
- `hG0cv` and `hG0cc`, the envelope inputs of L1–L2.

All six follow from `hT` and from `|f_xxx| ≤ m` on the pin segment, and `ridge_capHyp_C5` derives
them. Up to v2.0 the bounds `m` were also assumed on a collar `[−2r − ε, 2r + ε]` of SP's `D`.
`ridge_capHyp_D` assumes them on `D` only, through the continuity step `block_bound_collar` (I3). -/

/-- **L3's `x`-input from the block bound.** Let `y ↦ ∂_y f (t, y)` have derivative `H (t, 0)` at `0`
and `Df` have derivative `D2f (t, 0)` at `(t, 0)` for every `t ∈ J`, where `J` is uniquely
differentiable at `x ∈ J`. If `t ↦ H (t, 0)` has derivative `Hx'` at `x`, then
`Hx' v w = T3 (x, 0) [(0, v), (0, w), (1, 0)]`, so `‖Hx'‖ ≤ m` when that block is at most
`m ‖v‖ ‖w‖`. This derives v1.6's hypothesis `hHxb`. -/

/-- **L3's radial input from the block bound.** Along the radius `τ ↦ (x, τ y)`, `τ ∈ [0, 1]`, if
`τ ↦ H (x, τ y)` has derivative `Hr'` at `s`, then `Hr' v w = T3 (x, s y) [(0, v), (0, w), (0, y)]`,
so `‖Hr'‖ ≤ m ‖y‖` when that block is at most `m ‖v‖ ‖w‖ ‖y‖`. The identification uses derivatives
within `[0, 1]`, so the endpoint `τ = 1` may lie on the sphere `‖y‖ = 2r`. This derives v1.6's

/-- **The continuity step of I3: the block bound from `D` to a collar.** Assume the block bound holds
with `m` on SP's `D = [−2r, 2r] × B̄(0, 2r)`. Assume also that on the collar
`[−2r − ε₀, 2r + ε₀] × B̄(0, 2r)` the `x`-derivative `T4` of `T3` exists and satisfies the same block
bound with some `K ≥ 0` (SP: `f ∈ C⁴` near `D`, so `‖D⁴ f‖` is bounded on a compact collar). Then the
block bound holds with `m + Kε` on the collar of width `ε ≤ ε₀`. Each collar point `(x, y)` is
within `ε` of a point `(x₀, y) ∈ D`, and the mean value inequality along `x` gives the rest. -/

/-- **The cap from SP's bounds on `D` (the continuity step of I3).** The quantitative hypotheses are
assumed on SP's `D` only:
- the block bound `m` and `|f_xxx| ≤ m` on the pin segment;
- SP's `M₄` blocks `n`;
- (H1) and (H2).

On a collar of some width `ε₀ > 0`, only qualitative data are assumed: the derivatives, the strict
derivative of `∂_y f`, and some bound `K ≥ 0` on the `x`-derivative of `T3` in block form (SP:
`f ∈ C⁴` near `D`). Because (H1) is strict, some `ε ∈ (0, ε₀]` keeps `8r(m + Kε)² < λ`.
`ridge_capHyp_C5` then applies with `m + Kε` (`block_bound_collar`). -/

/-! ### SP's `f ∈ C⁴` near `D` supplies the collar data (v2.2)

`block_of_norm` turns a bound on the norm of a trilinear form into the block bound, and
`collar_subset_open` finds a closed collar inside an open neighbourhood of `D`. `ridge_capHyp_E`
takes `f ∈ C⁴` on an open `U ⊇ D` and SP's quantitative bounds on `D`, written with the iterated
derivatives `iteratedFDeriv ℝ k f`. It builds every derivative datum of `ridge_capHyp_D` from `f`,
and it takes the collar width from `collar_subset_open` and `K` from the continuity of `D⁴f` on the
compact collar. -/

/-- **The block bound from the norm.** A trilinear form `B` on `ℝ × E` with `‖B‖ ≤ K` satisfies
the block bound with constant `K`. For `a = (s₁, y₁)`, `b = (s₂, y₂)`, `c = (s₃, y₃)` and
`e = (1, 0)`:
`|B(a, b, c) - s₁s₂s₃ B(e, e, e)| ≤ K((|s₁| + ‖y₁‖)(|s₂| + ‖y₂‖)(|s₃| + ‖y₃‖) - |s₁||s₂||s₃|)`.
Replacing one slot at a time by `sᵢ e` leaves three terms, and each has a transverse argument
`(0, yᵢ)`. -/

/-- **The cap from `f ∈ C⁴` near `D` and SP's bounds on `D` (I3's qualitative part).** Assume
that `f` is `C⁴` on an open `U ⊇ D` (SP: `f ∈ C⁴` near `D`). Assume also SP's quantitative
hypotheses on `D`, written with `D^k f(p)[v₁, …, v_k] = iteratedFDeriv ℝ k f p ![v₁, …, v_k]` and
`e = (1, 0)`:
- the block bound `m` on `D³f`, and `|f_xxx| ≤ m` on the pin segment;
- SP's `M₄` blocks `n`: `|D⁴f[e, e, e, e]| ≤ n` and `|D⁴f[(0, v), e, e, e]| ≤ n‖v‖`;
- (H1): `D²f(M)[(0, v), (0, v)] ≤ -λ‖v‖²` with `8rm² < λ`; and (H2);
- `M = (-r/2, 0)` and `S = (r/2, 0)` are critical, and `f(M) - f(S) = r³/6`.

Then `ridge_capHyp_D` applies. Its collar width comes from `collar_subset_open`, and its derivative
data are the Fréchet derivatives of `f` (`T3`, `T4` and `Φ4` are slices of `D³f` and `D⁴f`). Its
`K` bounds `‖D⁴f‖` on the compact collar. No derivative datum and no bound off `D` is assumed. -/

/-! ### A concrete instance and the necessity of each hypothesis

On `ℝ`, `toyF x = max (-|x|) (x - 2)` has a local maximum `M = 0` at height `b = 0`, a
separating local minimum `S = 1` at height `s = -1`, and an older point `z = 3` at height `1`.
The cap is `[-2, 1]`. The instance shows that `CapHyp` is satisfiable (the theorems are not
vacuous), and the three counterexamples show that dropping (C1), (C2) or (C3) breaks the
maximin conclusion. -/

/-- **`ridge_capHyp_D` is not vacuous.** `h1ToyF` meets every hypothesis of `ridge_capHyp_D` with
`ε₀ = 1/2`. `T3` is constant, so `T4 = 0` and `K = 0`, and `|f_xxx| = 2 = m` on the pin segment.
The theorem chooses the collar width itself. It gives the ridge on `(−2 − ε, 2 + ε)` for some

/-! ### v2.4: the cap on P §7's event `G_r`, for every pin gap `k > 0`

P §7 (`imports/lifetime_parent_20260925/UNIFORM_MATRIX_CAP_AND_LIFETIME.md`) uses the deterministic
cap on `G_r = {λ_min(−A_M) > [4/(3k)] r M3², r M4 ≤ 3k/10}` with the pin gap `f(M) − f(S) = k r³`.
`ridge_capHyp_E` is the case `k = 1/6`. A positive factor `f ↦ c f` multiplies every derivative
bound and the transverse curvature by `c`, and changes neither the critical points nor the cap. -/

/-! ### v2.5: CAP (1) in its own partial-block norms

CAP §1 (`imports/lifetime_parent_20260925/MARKED_CYLINDER_CAP_PROOF.md`) states the deterministic
theorem with `M_j = max_{a+c=j} sup_D ‖∂_x^a D_y^c f‖_op` (`c` transverse Euclidean unit vectors,
chosen independently) and `λ = λ_min(−D_y² f(M))`, under (1): `λ > (4/(3κ)) r M_3²`,
`r M_4 ≤ 3κ/10`. `ridge_capHyp_K` takes the third derivative as one block inequality `hT`.
`block_of_partial` derives `hT` from CAP's partial blocks with `c = 1, 2, 3`, using the symmetry of
`D³f`, which holds for `f ∈ C³` (`iteratedFDeriv_three_swap₁₂`, `iteratedFDeriv_three_swap₂₃`).
`ridge_capHyp_blocks` then states the cap under CAP's hypotheses as written. -/

/-- **CAP's partial blocks give the block inequality.** For a symmetric trilinear form `B` on
`ℝ × E`, bounds by `m` on the three partial blocks with `c = 1, 2, 3` transverse slots, namely

multilinearly: the seven mixed terms are partial blocks in some slot order, symmetry brings each to
the canonical order, and their bounds add up to `m(Π(|sᵢ| + ‖yᵢ‖) − Π|sᵢ|)`. No sign of `m` is
