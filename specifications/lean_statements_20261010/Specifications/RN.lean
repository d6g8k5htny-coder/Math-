This module states, as `Prop`-valued definitions, the shapes of the RN-track results:
the abstract probability-to-count interface (N1)-(N5) of RN_COUNT_INTERFACE.md, the
fixed-remote Theorem A displays (2) and (3) of remote_window_20260924/PROOF.md, the
fixed-annulus height-window candidate (A2) of FIXED_ANNULUS_CANDIDATE.md, the all-height
annulus bridge display (2) of rn_annulus_bridge_20260925/PROOF.md, the six reconciled
rows D5-a ... D5-f of RECONCILIATION.md, the headline displays of Theorems P_d, C_d,
I_d, G_d of d5_dimension_lift_20260929/PROOF.md, the planar (F4) display of
c6_fourier_cutoff_20260929/PROOF.md, Theorem Q and Corollary Theta of
c6_palm_route_20260929/PROOF.md, Theorem O of c6_rare_cluster_laws_20260929/PROOF.md,
Corollary D of remote_collision_20260928/PROOF.md, and, labelled as an OPEN obligation
whose Prop is a target and not a result, the regional near-pin witness-collision
second-moment target of GRAPH node `math.rn-region.witness-collision`.

Every statement about the pinned Gaussian model is parametrised by an interface object
`PinnedLawInterface`: the sample space, the sample paths, the Gaussian regression law
`Q_r`, the typed endpoint weight `W_r`, the tilted law `Q_r^W = (W_r/Z_r) Q_r` and the
contact kernel `Lambda_j` are GIVEN; their Gaussian-regression construction, the
determinant form of the weight and the Kac-Rice representation of the kernel are informal
in the sources and are not transcribed. The pin equations, the positivity of the normalizer
and the exact tilt are required only in the pin regime `0 < r < L`, this module's reading of
the sources' "For small r>0 the pins are" (for `0 < r < L` the two pins are distinct modulo
`L Z^d`, so the pin equations are consistent with `L`-periodicity); outside that regime the
laws are unconstrained given probability measures. The statements are about whatever objects satisfy
the interface; the identification of those objects with the objects of the source texts is
not part of any statement.

This module is self-contained: it imports only Mathlib and re-declares, up to the
namespace, the shared objects of `Specifications/Field.lean` that it needs (ambient space,
lattice vectors, Hessian form, critical points, inertia, pins, torus distance, fundamental
domain): the nine bodies are byte-identical to Field.lean's, and so are the docstrings except
the `Does not claim:` lines of `pinM` and `pinS`, which are module-specific (Field.lean
records that no statement there consumes the pins; here the interface and the window
statements consume them). The duplication is deliberate at this layer and is recorded as
such.

What this module does not establish. It consists only of definitions and structures; it
states nothing as a result and proves nothing: none of Theorem N, Theorem A, the annulus
candidates, the D5 rows, the dimension lift, the C6 bounds, the rare-cluster Poisson
obstruction or the collision target is shown here, and no kernel receipt about them exists. It does not
construct the Gaussian field or the regression law `Q_r`; it does not transcribe the
determinant/inertia form of `W_r` (only its sign and typing), the normalizer floor
`Z_r >= z_* r^2`, the observation transform `U_r`, the coupling estimates, the weighted
Kac-Rice formulas (N6), (12), (A21), (16), (3.1) or the contact-kernel integral (13); it
asserts no numerical constant, radius or cutoff; it does not state the two-scale, thin-tube,
microdisk, collar, intermediate-window or elder sources that the D5 rows consume; it does
not state Theorem F (F1)-(F2) or Proposition B of the Fourier cutoff note, Corollary P of
the Palm route, Theorems C and S of the rare-cluster note, or Theorem C / Corollaries E, F
of the remote-collision note; and it does not assert that the open target is attainable.
Nothing here promotes, reclassifies or discharges any claim, premise or obligation of the
registers: the landing dispositions `HOLD_WITH_DOMAIN` (rn-count-interface,
rn-fixed-remote-window) and `REVIEWED_SCOPED` (rn-fixed-annulus-window), and the GRAPH
classifications of the `math.rn-region.*` nodes (including `OPEN_ACTIVE` for
`witness-collision`), are transcribed from the registers by the statement register, never
re-derived here; alignment of these statements with the sources is
PENDING_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.

/-! ### The pinned weighted law as an interface -/

/-- Interface for the pinned Gaussian regression law and its determinant tilt. The sample
space `Ω` and its sigma-algebra are parameters; the sample paths `F`, the regression law
`Q_r = Q r b k R` on the `2(d+1)` pin observations at `M = -(r/2)u`, `S = (r/2)u`
(`u = R e_1`), the typed endpoint weight `W_r`, the tilted law `Q_r^W` and the contact
kernel `Lambda_j` are GIVEN. The hypothesis fields transcribe: smooth `L`-periodic sample
paths; `Q_r` is a probability measure under which, in the pin regime `0 < r < L`, the
`2(d+1)` pin equations hold almost surely; `W_r ≥ 0` vanishes unless `H_M` is negative
definite and `H_S` has index `d-1`; in the same regime `Z_r = E_(Q_r) W_r > 0` and
`dQ_r^W = (W_r/Z_r) dQ_r` exactly (`Measure.withDensity`); and `Q_r^W` is a probability
measure. The regime `0 < r < L` is this module's reading of the source clause "For small r>0
the pins are": for `0 < r < L` the pins `M`, `S` are distinct modulo `L Z^d` (`‖S - M‖ = r`
while every nonzero lattice vector has norm at least `L`), so the pin equations are
consistent with `L`-periodicity; without the gate the structure would have no inhabitant for
`L > 0` (at `r = L` along a coordinate frame the two pins coincide on the torus, so the pin
values `b` and `b - k r^3` would be prescribed at one point). The Gaussian-regression
construction of `Q_r`, the determinant factors `|det H_M| |det H_S|` of `W_r` and the
Kac-Rice contact representation (13) of `Lambda_j` are informal in the sources and are NOT
transcribed. Existence of such an object is not asserted (a Dirac mass at one smooth
`L`-periodic sample path with the prescribed pin values, a nondegenerate maximum at `M` and a
nondegenerate index-`(d-1)` saddle at `S`, with `W = 1` on that path, would satisfy the gated
fields; this consistency remark is not a statement of this module).

`E_(Q_r^W) N(N-1) ≤ C r^3 log(1/r)` for `0 < r ≤ r_*`, all `b, k, R`. The source derives
this from Theorem W with `p = 2`; the hypothesis `G_2` is stated as a hypothesis here, not
discharged.

/-- Shape of Theorem O (sharp ordinary-Poisson obstruction): for a family of laws
`μ_r` on `ℕ` (the law of the window count `N_r`) which, for all sufficiently small `r`
(that is, for `0 < r ≤ r_0` for some `r_0 > 0`), are probability mass functions with
summable mean satisfying only (H1) `E N_r ≤ A r^3` and (H2) `P(N_r ≥ 2) ≥ a r^3` with
`a > 0`: then, for all sufficiently small `r`,
`(a/2) r^3 ≤ inf_{lambda ≥ 0} dTV(Law N_r, Pois(lambda)) ≤ A r^3`: every nonnegative
intensity is at distance at least `(a/2) r^3`, and some intensity is within `A r^3`. The
hypotheses are imposed only on `0 < r ≤ r_0`, as in the source ("for all sufficiently small
r"); imposing (H2) for every `r > 0` would be unsatisfiable (`a r^3 ≤ 1` fails for large
`r`) and would make the statement hold for every family. The source's remark that the
premises imply `2a ≤ A` is not taken as a hypothesis.

Does not claim: the result (Theorem O) or its proof; that `2a ≤ A` (derived in the source, not a hypothesis here); that H1 or H2 hold for the Gaussian window count (the source takes them from [D5] Theorem G_d and [C6] Corollary Theta); the mean-matched statement `lambda = mu`; Theorems C and S, the factorial-moment matching or the independent-replica limit; the conditional-law liminf remark; that the upper half is the source's infimum bound verbatim: `∃ lam ≥ 0, dTV(Law N_r, Pois(lam)) ≤ A r^3` implies `inf_{lam ≥ 0} dTV ≤ A r^3` and is stronger unless the infimum is attained, and the existential form is used because the source's proof exhibits the witness `lam = 0` (the source: The upper bound in (3.1) uses Pois(0)=delta_0 and dTV(Law N,delta_0)=p); nonauthor review or acceptance. -/

/-! ### Remote collision (Corollary D) and the OPEN witness-collision target -/

/-- Shape of Corollary D (second factorial moment in the fixed remote region): fixed `d ≥ 2`,
`L > 0`, `0 < ρ < L/4`, compact marks; there are `C` and `r_* > 0` such that for
`0 < r ≤ r_*`, all marks and frames and every Borel `E ⊆ D_ρ`,
`E_(Q_r^W) N(E)(N(E)-1) ≤ C r^5 |E|` and `Q_r^W{ N(E) ≥ 2 } ≤ C r^5 |E|`, where
`N(E) = sum_j N_j(E)` is the sum of the index-`j` window counts in `E`
(`windowCountIndexSum`, the source's definition). Pairs at every mutual separation inside
`D_ρ`, down to coincidence, are included.

`math.rn-region.witness-collision` (classification OPEN_ACTIVE, catalog C6): the regional
shrinking pin/witness-collision mechanism. The reconciliation describes what is missing as
a torus-wide second factorial moment of the window count "with pairs where at least one
witness is within fixed `η` of a pin", at every mutual separation (the fixed-remote `P_η`
of Corollary D covers only pairs with both witnesses at distance `≥ η` from the pins). The
Prop below is that target: fixed `d ≥ 2`, `L > 0`, `η > 0`, compact marks; there are `C` and
`r_* > 0` with `E_(Q_r^W) #{ordered window pairs with the first witness within η of a pin} ≤ C r^3`
for `0 < r ≤ r_*`, all `b, k, R`. No source in this packet establishes it; its register
status is OPEN and this declaration does not change that.
